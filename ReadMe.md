## This Repository contains 2 Assembly Language Project codes, some main points to be noted about the programs are:

- MASM/TASM Assembler & 8086 Architecture is used in these programs.
- Handled Error of relative jump in many possiblities.
- Added Exceptional Handlings at some specifc points.
- Optimized & fixed from crashing, glitches & bugs.

# Calculator Program

Some main features integrated into calculator are

- Addition -> Performs Addition 2 digits decimal numebr
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division -> Displays answer in float (upto 2 decimal places)
- Square of Number
- Multiplication Table -> (Upto 10 times)


### Concepts of Stack, Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Labels, Conditional Jumps, Data Storage, Relative Jumps & Data Manipulation is mainly used in this project.


#### Note: In division, if user enters "0" as a divisor,it displays a custom error & asks for Input again (Exception Handling). In subtraction, if user gives command of subtracting a smaller number from a bigger number, it displays answer in negative (Exception handling) this does not crashes or glitches the program.

# Food Ordering

A menu displays, at the time of running the program, which includes a list of options, commands & food items along with the price of each. With the selection of food items, it displays the previous selected items & their prices in cart. In case of wrong selection, user can still have an option of clearing the cart & go through selection from start.
