This program consists of 3 MACROs and 8 PROCs & prints a Thank message using Graphics.
MACROs:
- printString -> Prints the string by using "ah, 9" service routine
- printResult -> Prints the output by using "ah, 2" service routine
- input -> Takes the input by using "ah, 1" service routine

PROCs:
* Main:
- It prints each line of Instruction's Menu & guides user to press the key according to user Choice
- It compares user Input and jumps to that specific Procedure
- At the end of Procedure it jumps again to main Procedure making it an infinte loop
- The loop will only terminate if user presses '0' which will end the loop as well as program 

* Jumper:
- It's function is to jump back to the (firstLoop) of Main Procedure.
- It minimizes the distance of conditional jump, thus it also resolves error(relative jump out of range).

* Addition:
- Takes 2 inputs (of 2 digit each), adds them & gives the result in 3 digits.

* Subtraction:
- Takes 2 inputs (1 for each number) and subtracts them, even if the answer is negative.

* Division:
- Takes 2 inputs (1 for each number), divides them and gives result in form of float upto 2 decimal places.
- If user enters Divisior as 0 then it throws an error.

* Multiplication:
- Takes 2 inputs (1 for each number) and multiplies them.

* Square:
- Takes 1 input & gives the result by multiplying the input by itself.

* Multiplication Table:
- Takes an input & multiplies each number from 1 to 10 using a loop.

END:
- Prints a message a 'Thank you' message if user exits the program using Graphics.
