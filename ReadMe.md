These 2 projects (Calculator Project & Food Ordering Project) are completely different from each other functionality wise.
- These 2 are a part of Assembly Language Project
- MASM/TASM Assembler & 8086 Architecture is used in these programs.
- Its not very modernized but I tried to optimize them in every possible conditions.
- Handled Error of relative jump in many possiblities, and fixed it.
- Added Exceptional Handlings in some places,

NOT A PERFECT CODE, CAUSE PERFECTION DOESN'T EXSIST.
